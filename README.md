## Introduction

The **Smart Home Automation System** is designed to enhance your living space by providing a reliable and user-friendly method to control various home functions. The system leverages the power of the ESP32 microcontroller, known for its robust connectivity features, making it ideal for IoT applications. With Blynk, users can easily manage their home environment from their smartphones.

## Features

- **Remote Control**: Manage doors, garages, and rain covers from anywhere using the Blynk app.
- **Automation**: Use IR and rain sensors to automate actions, ensuring convenience and safety.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The Blynk app offers an intuitive interface for easy interaction.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Receive notifications for specific events, such as rain detection.
- **Expandable**: Easily add more features and sensors as needed.

## Components Used

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: The heart of the system, providing Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.
- **Blynk IoT Platform**: For remote control and monitoring.
- **Servos**: To control doors, garages, and rain covers.
- **IR Sensors**: For detecting movement and automating door operations.
- **Rain Sensors**: To automatically close the rain cover during rain.
- **Power Supply**: To power the ESP32 and other components.

## Installation

To get started with the Smart Home Automation System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RayZ0r-007YT/Smart-Home-Automation-System.git
   cd Smart-Home-Automation-System
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Make sure to install the necessary libraries for the ESP32 and Blynk. You can do this through the Arduino IDE Library Manager.

3. **Upload the Code**:
   Open the project in the Arduino IDE, connect your ESP32, and upload the code.

4. **Set Up Blynk**:
   - Create a Blynk account if you don't have one.
   - Set up a new project and add the necessary widgets for controlling doors, garages, and rain covers.
   - Copy the Auth Token provided by Blynk and paste it into the code.

5. **Connect Sensors**:
   Follow the wiring diagram in the repository to connect the servos, IR sensors, and rain sensors to the ESP32.

6. **Power Up**:
   Power the ESP32 and ensure all components are connected properly.

7. **Download Releases**:
   For the latest updates and releases, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/RayZ0r-007YT/Smart-Home-Automation-System/releases) to download and execute the necessary files.

## Usage

Once the system is set up, you can control your home automation features through the Blynk app. Here‚Äôs how to use the main functionalities:

- **Controlling Doors**: Use the app to open or close doors remotely.
- **Garage Control**: Manage your garage door with a simple tap.
- **Rain Cover Automation**: The rain sensor will automatically close the cover when it detects rain.
- **Notifications**: Set up alerts in the Blynk app to receive notifications based on sensor inputs.

## How It Works

The Smart Home Automation System operates on a straightforward principle:

1. **User Input**: The user sends commands through the Blynk app.
2. **ESP32 Processing**: The ESP32 receives the commands and processes them.
3. **Actuation**: Based on the commands, the ESP32 activates the appropriate servos or sensors.
4. **Feedback Loop**: The system sends feedback to the user via the Blynk app, ensuring real-time updates.

### Example Workflow

1. **User opens the Blynk app**.
2. **User taps the button to open the garage**.
3. **ESP32 receives the command** and activates the servo to open the garage door.
4. **User receives a confirmation notification** that the garage is now open.
